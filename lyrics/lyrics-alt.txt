# verse

I envy the moon
folding the tides
there where you are

the bright mother monsoon
  the bright mother of monsoons
who blankets your nights

oh, can my yen
let you go?
what good moon would swallow
the I in team and leave us so

  # prechorus
  if I offer our past
  buried in sand
  will I still have the things
  I understand

all good things remain
  僕がいないのに
all good things remain
  僕がいないのに
even without me
  もの続く

the sun falling to shore
heavy and warm
there where you are

my thoughts taking your form
  but our undertow's strong
like storms from afar
  so cold from afar

can my yen
let you go?
what good moon would swallow
the I in team and leave us so

all good things remain
all good things remain
even without me
even without me

all good things remain
all good things remain
even without me
