satellites

so full I must have eaten up all the ocean

my gravity still holds you close
since we used to be one
my body stretched out on your shore
but my arms don't touch you anymore

underneath me, you left a town full of clocks
and I press down, a day at a time
the teeth of my face to stop your hands
to unmake the month-counters as beautiful as mine

your planetsides sidereal time, daylight and night line, moving
through empty space, strange voices, sugared days, falling
moon, meadow rays,

I am

out on the sand
out on the sand
  and she'll go away


I look into the golden water

I turn into the moon
in the golden light
and the work of my enemy
is my food through magic

in my one hand, I carry fear
in my one hand, I carry love

I would give up the hand
that holds the other
to only hold one


be honest with yourself
change your lifestyle
physically move
change your friends / associates
let go of shared habits and things that remind you of them

burying stuff
burning stuff
eat stuff
plant a tree over stuff
