I'm jealous of the moon
who folds in the tides
  who tucks in the tides
  who rolls in the tides
  who tucks all the tides
  pulling the tides
  tucking the tides
there where you are
  into the shore
  over the shore
  far from the salt
  close to the salt

the bright mother of monsoons
  the white mother of monsoons
who blankets your nights
when clouds fall apart
  who blankets the night
  who blankets your days
  marking the time
  immortal and full
  precious and full
  'til clouds come apart
  in tropical storms
  under/in tropical stars
  when clouds come apart
  before clouds come apart/depart
  until clouds depart
  'til clouds come apart
  in sweltering stars

if I offer up our past
  if I give away our past
  if I cover up my face
cover it with/in sand
  cover you in/with sand
  do away with my pride
  make peace with my pride
  cover up my pride
  cataract my pride
  counteract my pride
  cataract the nile
will I leave another tree
  will I leave behind a tree
  will I see it in my dreams
  will I water it in dreams
  will I take the empty space
  can I manage to accept
  can I manage to replace
  replace you with this empty space
  the river of my waste
  the river of my shame
and come to understand
  will I come to understand
  and nourish the land
  you're gone from my side
  you're gone far away
  your body's empty space
  your body's empty place
  my body's empty space

all good things remain
  # some combination of remain and abide?
  all good things abide
  all good things
  good things will
    abide
    endure
    prevail
    persist
    remain
    camp out
  some good things exist
  all good things will come
  all good things may come
  still good things exist
  I know good exists
  something good exists
  all good things exist
  all your warmth exists
  all your joy exists
  can exist?
all good things remain
even without me

the sun falling on the shore
  your former orbit's filled
  your perigee is filled
keeping you warm
  by murmur of salt
there where you are

but our undertow is strong
  but the old undertow is strong
  but this undertow is yours
  but this gravity is yours
and cold from afar
  and strong from afar
  so strong from afar
  but fair from afar
  but faint from afar

if I offer up our past
cover it with/in sand
will I leave another tree
and come to understand

all good things remain
all good things remain
even without me
