The Monsoon Mother
Find Of Less
Pour Of Less
A Never-Seen Sea
So Much At Ease
All Flat Maps
Sun Rise Over Horizon
Meet | Leave
Finding Of Less To You
Pouring Of Less To You
Echoing Of Less To You
Strew of Less

This is a song about humility,
about feeling happy that something good exists, even if you didnâ€™t make it,
even if it is not what you want.

I'm jealous of the moon where you are
can I let go of my attachment?
all good things exist, even without me
