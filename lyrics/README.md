```lyrics
I envy the moon
folding the tides
there where you are

the bright mother monsoon
who blankets your nights

oh, can my yen
let you go?
what good moon would swallow
the I in team and leave us so

all good things remain
all good things remain
even without me

the sun falling to shore
heavy and warm
there where you are

my thoughts taking your form
like storms from afar

can my yen
let you go?
what good moon would swallow
the I in team and leave us so

all good things remain
all good things remain

even without me
even without me

all good things remain
all good things remain
even without me
```
