Mother Of Monsoons
==================

This is a song about feeling happy that something good exists even if you
didn't make it, even if it makes your life more difficult.

Story Summary
-------------
We had a connection. One day you left.

You left and I wanted you to come back. You left and I felt happy for your new
happiness.

Now I wonder if I can let go of my pride and embrace your happiness far away
from me.

Who's Talking
-------------
You're not here, but I'm talking to you. We talked through so many things when
we were together. Talking to you lets me pretend for a moment that you're
still with me. Maybe you can help me work past my ego.
